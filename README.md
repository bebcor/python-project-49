**Brain games** is a CLI program that includes five logic mini-games (Parity check, Calculator, Greatest Common Divisor, Lost element of the arithmetic progression, is it a prime number?) to train thinking through solving arithmetic and mathematical problems.
It is implemented as separate commands, with interactive rounds and verification of user responses in the terminal.
